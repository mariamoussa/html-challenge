            <p> Mahatma Gandhi was the primary leader of India’s independence movement and also the architect of a form of
                non-violent civil disobedience that would influence the world. Until Gandhi was assassinated in 1948, his life and
                teachings inspired activists including Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. </p>

            <p>
                Mahatma Gandhi was the leader of India’s non-violent independence movement against British rule and in South Africa who
                advocated for the civil rights of Indians. Born in Porbandar, India, Gandhi studied law and organized boycotts against
                British institutions in peaceful forms of civil disobedience. He was killed by a fanatic in 1948.

            <h2>Life and Education</h2>
                <p>Indian nationalist leader Gandhi (born Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi) was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Kathiawar,
                India, which was then part of the British Empire.
                Gandhi’s father, Karamchand Gandhi, served as a chief minister in Porbandar and other states in western India. His
                mother, Putlibai, was a deeply religious woman who fasted regularly.
                Young Gandhi was a shy, unremarkable student who was so timid that he slept with the lights on even as a teenager. In
                the ensuing years, the teenager rebelled by smoking, eating meat and stealing change from household servants.
                Although Gandhi was interested in becoming a doctor, his father hoped he would also become a government minister and
                steered him to enter the legal profession. In 1888, 18-year-old Gandhi sailed for London, England, to study law. The
                young Indian struggled with the transition to Western culture.
                Upon returning to India in 1891, Gandhi learned that his mother had died just weeks earlier. He struggled to gain his
                footing as a lawyer. In his first courtroom case, a nervous Gandhi blanked when the time came to cross-examine a
                witness. He immediately fled the courtroom after reimbursing his client for his legal fees.

                Gandhi grew up worshiping the Hindu god Vishnu and following Jainism, a morally rigorous ancient Indian religion that
                espoused non-violence, fasting, meditation and vegetarianism.
                During Gandhi’s first stay in London, from 1888 to 1891, he became more committed to a meatless diet, joining the
                executive committee of the London Vegetarian Society, and started to read a variety of sacred texts to learn more about
                world religions.
                Living in South Africa, Gandhi continued to study world religions. “The religious spirit within me became a living
                force,” he wrote of his time there. He immersed himself in sacred Hindu spiritual texts and adopted a life of
                simplicity, austerity, fasting and celibacy that was free of material goods.
